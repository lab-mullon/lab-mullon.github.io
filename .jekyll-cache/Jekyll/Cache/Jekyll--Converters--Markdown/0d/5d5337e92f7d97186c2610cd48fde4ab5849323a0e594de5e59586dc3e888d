I"Å<p>In this project, we use mathematical models and computer simulations to study the population genetics of subdivided populations. We are especially interested in the time taken by new mutations to fix, when these mutations affect competitive or social traits. The goal is to better understand how dispersal, life history, genetic dominance and population structure interact and influence adaptation and the molecular signature of such adaptation.</p>
