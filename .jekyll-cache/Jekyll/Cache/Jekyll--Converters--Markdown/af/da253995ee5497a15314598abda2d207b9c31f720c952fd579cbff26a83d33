I"=<p>This weekend we had our Lab retreat 2022, a moment to celebrate our friendship! It was also a special moment to say goodbye to Max and Marco. Max finished his post-doc in our lab and is moving to the U. of Tübingen, while Marco successfully finished his Master’s project with us and will soon pursue a PhD.</p>
