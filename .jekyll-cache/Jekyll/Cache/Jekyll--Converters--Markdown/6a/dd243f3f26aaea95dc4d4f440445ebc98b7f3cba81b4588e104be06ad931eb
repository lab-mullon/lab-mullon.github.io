I"<p>By determining gene flow among groups in a population, dispersal plays a major role in many ecological and evolutionary processes. As gene flow shapes kin structure, dispersal is particularly relevant to the evolution of social behaviours such as cooperation. Simultaneously, dispersal evolution depends on kin structure and how such structure is influenced by social behaviour. Dispersal and social behaviour therefore co-evolve in non-trivial ways. Using a mathematical model, we show here that this coevolution readily leads to the emergence of two social morphs: a sessile, cooperating morph; and a dispersive, selfish morph. This social polymorphism arises due to a positive linkage between the loci responsible for dispersal and social behaviour, leading to cooperating individuals preferentially interacting with relatives and selfish individuals with non-relatives. In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0397-y">this work</a>, we find that this linkage is favoured under a large spectrum of conditions, suggesting associations between dispersal and other social traits should be common in nature. This prediction is supported by findings in multiple organisms ranging from protozoa to primates, with potentially significant ecological and genetic implications.</p>
