I"]<p>Our first lab retreat happened from October 10th to 12th in a chalet in the swiss alps. It was a great opportunity to spend time together, either playing <em>6 qui prend</em>, hiking in Portes de Culet or cooking dinners¹. We also had an amazing experience in thermal pools and saunas. The photo above is in <strong>Val-d’Illiez</strong>.</p>
