I"O<p>Ecological inheritance can be described as the process by which individuals modify their environment and transmit it to the next generations. As organisms highly depend on their environment for reproduction and survival, individuals that transmit better environments to their offspring are more likely to succeed. Therefore, the structure of the populations (i.e., how likely it is for offspring to live in the same environment as their parents) and the type of interactions impacting the ecology will determine which morphs are favoured by natural selection. In this project, I use an adaptive dynamics approach in order to find if, under different conditions and with different types of interactions, co-existence between different life-history strategies is possible. I compare these theoretical results to individual based simulations.</p>
