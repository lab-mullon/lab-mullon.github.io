Ewan successfully passed his PhD viva at Imperial College London. Well-deserved, congratulations Dr. Flintham! 

He studyied the evolutionary genetics of sex-specific selection and sexual conflict. In particular, his work centres around the role of population ecology in influencing the evolution of sex differences, and the repercussions this can have for patterns of genetic variation in natural populations.

We are also extremely happy that Ewan is coming to Lausanne for a postdoc in October.
