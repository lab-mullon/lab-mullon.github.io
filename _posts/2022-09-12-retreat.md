This weekend we had our lab retreat 2022, a moment to celebrate our friendship! It was also a special moment to say goodbye to Max and Marco. 

Our adventure this time was going down the Aare river in a boat, from Thun to Bern.

After that, we had a lovely dinner in Bern, where we gave to Max and Marco a few souvenirs and encouraging words to their next advantures. You both will be missed in Lausanne!!
