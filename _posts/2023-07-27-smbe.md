The meeting of Society for Molecular Biology & Evolution (SMBE) 2023, held in the lovely Italian city of Ferrara from July 23rd to 27th, served as a significant gathering for scientists and researchers in the field of evolutionary biology. 
Among the attendees, Ewan and Thomas from our Lab showcased their exciting research in evolutionary ecology in two posters.
