The meeting of Society for Molecular Biology & Evolution (SMBE) 2023 held in the lovely Italian city of Ferrara, served as a significant gathering for scientists and researchers in the field of evolutionary biology. Among the attendees, Ewan and Thomas from our Lab showcased their exciting research in evolutionary ecology in two posters.

Shortly we'll make their posters available here as well.
