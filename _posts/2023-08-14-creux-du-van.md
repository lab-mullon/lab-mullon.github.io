Our lab decided to take a break from our usual office routines and embarked on a 4-hour hike to Creux Du Van in Switzerland. 
Surrounded by the breathtaking landscape of cliffs and valleys, we found ourselves in a perfect setting for inspiration. 
We had the company a few members of Pannell and Lehmann groups.

Against the backdrop of awe-inspiring views, we engaged in relaxed discussions about evolutionary theory, in particular genetic architecture.
The juxtaposition of the serene hike and the intellectually stimulating discussions created a unique experience.
