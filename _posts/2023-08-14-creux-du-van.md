Our lab decided to take a break from our usual office routines and embarked on a 4-hour hike to Creux Du Van in Switzerland. 
Surrounded by the breathtaking landscape of cliffs and valleys, we found ourselves in a perfect setting for inspiration. 
We had the company a few members of Pannell and Lehmann groups.

Against the backdrop of awe-inspiring views, we engaged in relaxed discussions about evolutionary theory, in particular genetic architecture and the contribution of Orr to the Fisher's geometric model.
Ewan also told us all about what he saw at the SMBE conference a few weeks ago.
The movie Oppenheimer was also a headted debate *hahah*


The juxtaposition of this beautiful landscape and the intellectually stimulating discussions created a unique experience.
