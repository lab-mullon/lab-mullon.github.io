Registration is now open for the **UNIL Summer School on Modelling for Evolutionary Biology**, to be held in Lausanne from **1 to 6 September 2025**.

This is an intensive week of lectures, practical sessions, and collaborative work, aimed primarily at **PhD students** with an interest in applying formal models to questions in evolutionary ecology. We cover the fundamentals of invasion analysis and its links to population and quantitative genetics, applying these tools to topics such as sexual selection, social evolution, senescence, and life history evolution.

The course is open to participants from any institution, and we particularly welcome international students. **The application deadline is 15 June.** *Scholarships covering travel and tuition are also available, with a separate deadline of 15 May.*
