Thomas, Ewan, Iris and Vitor attended the [PopGroup56](https://www.populationgeneticsgroup.org.uk/), which took place at Queen Mary University London, from January 4th to 6th.

Thomas, Ewan, Iris and Vitor presented a short talk each. 

A big shout out to Goudet group members who also joined us there and represented Lausanne so well.
