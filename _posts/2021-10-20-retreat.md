Our first lab retreat happened from October 10th to 12th in a chalet in the swiss alps. It was a great opportunity to spend time together, either playing *6 qui prend*, hiking in Portes de Culet or cooking dinners¹. We also had an amazing experience in thermal pools and saunas. The photo above is in **Val-d'Illiez**. 

¹ A nice pasta recipe includes raisins.
