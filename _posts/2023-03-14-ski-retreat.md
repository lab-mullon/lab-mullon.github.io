This weekend we had our Lab retreat 2023 together with Laurent Lehmann lab. That was a nice opportunity to get to know more about each other and to discuss a lot of theory while eating some raclette!

Our adventure this time was going down the slopes of the Portes du Soleil snowpark, in the border between Switzerland and France.

We discovered that our group is composed of quite good skiers (except Vitor in the baby slopes!). 

Congratulations Ewan for nailing the Le Mur Suisse for the first time, the only yellow slope of the park!
