Together with the Lehmann group, we had our first Lab retreat of 2023 on the slopes of the Portes du Soleil snowpark at the French-Swiss border.

Our adventure this time was going down the slopes of the Portes du Soleil snowpark, in the border between Switzerland and France.

It was a great opportunity to discuss some theory while eating some raclette, as well as discovering the hidden skiing talents of the group (even Vitor managed to leave the baby slopes!).

Congratulations Ewan for nailing Le Mur Suisse for the first time, the only yellow slope of the park!
