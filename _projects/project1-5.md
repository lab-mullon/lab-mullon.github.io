In anisogamous organisms, how individuals allocate their resources to the production of male and female gametes (sex allocation) can vary extensively both between species and between individuals within species, resulting in a wide diversity of sexual systems ranging from hermaphroditism, where individuals produce male and female gametes, to separate sexes, where individuals specialise in one sex. A central topic in the study of sexual systems is to understand how and why evolutionary transitions between different systems occur. Here, we use a combination of mathematical modelling and computer simulations to investigate how these transitions are influenced by the co-evolution of sex allocation with other traits, and how evolution shapes the genetic basis of sexual systems during these transitions. For example, our most recent work elucidates how the co-evolution of sex allocation with its underlying genetic architecture readily leads to the emergence of heterogametic sex determination (XY/ZW systems) during the transition from hermaphroditism to separate sexes.

The pictures at the top of the page show an example of sex allocation variation in the andromonoecious flowering plant *Pulsatilla alpina*, which produces hermaphroditic flowers (with both pistils and stamens, left-hand panel) and pure male flowers (stamens only, right-hand panel). This species is perennial, and individuals generally produce a single flower per flowering season. Sex allocation is size-dependent: individuals behave as males when they are small and start producing hermaphroditic flowers once they grow larger, presumably because they then have more resources at their disposable.
