Organisms continuously modify their environment, often impacting the fitness of future conspecifics due to ecological inheritance. To understand the implications of such inheritance for phenotypic diversity, I use invasion analyses to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of traits in group-structured population, when traits affect the environment of a group that is then transmitted to the next generations.
My project has three main focus:
- the effect of ecological inheritance on the association of traits within phenotypes, and whether such association results in the emergence of phenotypic diversity.
- the effect of ecological inheritance on negative frequency-dependent selection, with a focus on social traits and their environmental effects.
- the effect of ecological inheritance on the evolution of context-dependent traits, and the ecological consequences of this evolution

In my first project (Prigent and Mullon, 2023), I derive the types of between-trait associations that are favored by ecological inheritance, and determine the condition under which those associations lead to the emergence of polymorphism. I find for instance that two traits become associated when one trait affects the environment while the other influences the likelihood that future kin experience this environment. To illustrate this, I have focused on the coevolution of (a) the attack rate on a local renewable resource, which deteriorates environmental conditions, with (b) dispersal between groups, which reduces the likelihood that kin suffers from such deterioration. I find this often leads to the emergence of two highly-differentiated morphs: one that readily disperses and depletes local resources (dispersive overconsumers); and another that maintains these resources and tends to remain philopatric (sessile scrimpers). I find that the emergence of those two morphs leads to eco-evolutionary cycles between the frequency of each morph and the abundance of the resource they feed on.

In my second project, I focus on the effect of ecological inheritance on negative frequency-dependent selection in the presence of spatial structure, that is, the conditions under which two differentiated morphs can stably coexist. I show that, contrary to what studies have found in the absence of ecological inheritance, spatial structure can reinforce negative frequency-dependent selection. In fact, negative-frequency dependent selection is the strongest when ecological inheritance is high and spatial structure is intermediate. When investigating the evolution of a helping trait with long lasting environmental effects, I find that ecological inheritance favors the emergence of helpers and cheaters. Those inequalities between individual strategies lead to inequalities between groups, which are reinforced by ecological inheritance and can persist across several generations.

Lastly, I will focus on the evolution of traits whose effect depends on the current environment they experience. As I have shown that ecological inheritance can lead to large environmental inequalities between groups, I will investigate whether such inequality favors the evolution of context-dependent traits, such as context-dependent helping (whereby individuals invest more or less depending on their environment) or context-dependent dispersal (whereby individuals may leave or stay in their patch depending on their environment). Such evolution would lead to phenotypic diversity in the overall population, while not necessarily being reflected at the genetic level.

My research then suggests that ecological inheritance can contribute to phenotypic diversity and lead to complex polymorphism.
