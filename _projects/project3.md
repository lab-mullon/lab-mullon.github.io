In this project, we use mathematical models and computer simulations to study the population genetics of subdivided populations. 
We are especially interested in the time that new mutations or alleles from the standing genetic variation take to fix in selective sweeps. 
The goal is to better understand how dispersal, life cycle, genetic dominance, and population structure interact and influence the pace of adaptation and the molecular signature of such adaptation.
